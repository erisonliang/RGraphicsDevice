</p><p>
Over the last two decades, R and S-Plus have had graphics devices
for common formats such as Postscript, PDF, JPEG, TIFF and PNG.
More recently, there is a graphics device that produces 
code that renders the graphical display when it is processed by  itself.
As Web 2.0 grows and there is a multitude of ways to display graphics
on the Web, it is becoming increasingly interesting to develop R graphics devices
which can display R graphics in different formats, venues and media.
For example, we might want to create a plot in R to be displayed within a Flash
"document". Similarly, we might want to display two R plots 
 in separate JavaScript canvas objects within an HTML page.
Or we might want to overlay contour lines or smooth surfaces 
computed and produced in R but displayed on Google Earth.
</p><p>
Not every new graphics format will stand the test of time, but it is
attractive to be able to rapidly generate R graphics targeted for 
that format.  Fortunately, the R graphics device model is extensible 
so that one can implement new devices as R packages and they will function in
exactly the same manner as those that come with R and might be considered "built-in" to R.
Unfortunately, to develop a graphics device typically involves writing C-code so
that the R graphic's engine can communicate directly and generically with that device.
C is a low-level language and is not as convenient for rapid prototyping as a high-level
language such as R.  Furthermore, many people who might want to target a new format
may not know C. Even if they do, they may not want to invest the time needed
to write the C code for an experimental graphics device.
And a further issue is that often a graphics device will perform a good deal of
string manipulation which is cumbersome in C.
</p><p>

These constraints and impediments are our motivation for developing
an approach by which R programmers can implement a full-fledged graphics device using R
code and no C code.  The idea is very straightforward. We implement a single 
R graphics device via C code.  Our graphics device by providing C routines
that implement each of the required graphical primitives
(i.e. circle, rectangle, text, new page, ...).
Each of these routines looks up the corresponding R function
registered with this instance of the graphics device to implement the graphical
primitive. If it is not registered, the routine does nothing. If it is available, 
the C routine calls that R function, passing the parameters it was called with,
e.g. the x and y coordinates and character string in a call to add text,
a collection of x and y coordinates for drawing lines.
The R function can do anything it likes  and will typically generate
content based on the inputs in order to render the graphical element.
</p><p>
In order to create a new graphics device, the R programmer need only supply
R functions to implement the graphical primitives in which she is interested.
She creates this collection by creating an instance of the S4 class
<i xmlns:s3="http://www.r-project.org/S3" xmlns:cpp="http://www.cplusplus.org" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns=""><a href="Help/RDevDescMethods-class.html">RDevDescMethods</a></i> and setting the relevant slots,
e.g. the <i xmlns:s3="http://www.r-project.org/S3" xmlns:cpp="http://www.cplusplus.org" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns="" class="rslot">line</i>, <i xmlns:s3="http://www.r-project.org/S3" xmlns:cpp="http://www.cplusplus.org" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns="" class="rslot">rect</i>, <i xmlns:s3="http://www.r-project.org/S3" xmlns:cpp="http://www.cplusplus.org" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns="" class="rslot">circle</i>
corresponding to the graphical primitives.
This structured collection is then passed to <i xmlns:s3="http://www.r-project.org/S3" xmlns:cpp="http://www.cplusplus.org" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns="" class="rfunc"><a href="Help//graphicsDevice.html">graphicsDevice()
  </a></i>
to create the actual graphics device instance and this becomes the active device.
While this is still active, any subsequent plotting commands in R are then 
routed through this device and the specified R functions.
</p><p>
Most R functions have no side effect. In other words, they
take inputs and return a result, but do not change any other variables
outside of their working environment, i.e. the call frame.
This is often termed functional programming and is a very useful paradigm.
However, our R functions are supposed to add instructions to create a graphical
element and store this somewhere. In this respect, we must update/modify some variables
that persist across calls to our graphical primitive functions so that we can collect
all the graphical elements in our display.
