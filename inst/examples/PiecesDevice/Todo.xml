getAxes fails on hexbin plot

<r:code>
e = test(plot(hexbin(rnorm(1000), rnorm(1000))))
x = getAxes(e)
length(x)  # 0
</r:code>

<item>
When we run
e = test(xyplot(mpg ~ wt | cyl, mtcars))
we are not seeing all of the tick labels on the 
horizontal axis.

getLatticeComponents
needs to separate the elements of the 
axes, etc. from the strips.

Merge with another device to produce
structured collections of graphical elements
into high-level objects, e.g. Axis objects,
e.g. Take the FlashMXML device and produce
the action script code, but then go further to assemble
them into data region, axis, axis, title objects.
Define classes in FlashMXML.
