<version id="0.5-0">
<change>
Added an IdentifyDevice example which stores the system calls in effect
when each primitive is invoked in the graphics device.
This can be used to help identify elements in a plot. See <omg:pkg>SVGAnnotation</omg:pkg>
and the JavaScript canvas example.
</change>
</version>

<version id="0.4-0">
<change>
Added a GEInitDevice function as part of the RDevDescMethods.  This is
different from the initDevice methods as that is called after the
device is created, while GEInitDevice is called after the device is
registered with the Graphics Engine in R. Specifically, the device has
been attached to a GEDevDesc data structure in C and so we can set the
display list settings, and whether to ask when moving to a new frame.
</change>
<change>
The values of the ipr parameter are used to set the corresponding
field when the device is created. This removes the need to set
these in the initDevice method.
</change>

<change>
Added default definitions for strWidth and metricInfo methods in 
RDevDescMethods.
</change>

<change>
Introduced class for GEDevDesc reference and coercion method
to convert a DevDescPtr to a GEDevDesc. This allows us to set
options for enabling the display list and asking the viewer
to confirm moving to a new "page".
</change>

<change>
Added a pieceDevice example device that collects the primitive
operations so that we can analyze/post-process them to identify
the different higher-level components in a  plot, e.g. axis, 
panels, title, axes labels.
</change>

</version>

<version>
<change>
Added DegenerateDeviceFunction class to be able to determine if a function
is the standard default one.
</change>

<change>Added accessor for slot "state" in the RDevDescMethodsPtr - 
get and set methods.
</change>

</version>
